<h2>About me</h2>
<p>
    I am an Indiana native, now residing in Atlanta, GA. I earned a Bachelor of Science in Psychology with a double minor in Dance and Mass Communications.
    <br/>Why am I transitioning to tech? First, I love continuous learning! I have always been drawn to the front-end aspects of websites. As a stretch project, I took the initiative to update my organization's website through their CMS. At some point, I also assisted with marketing materials and managed social media content.
    Design is another passion of mine. I am eager to pursue roles that allow me to merge my prior experience with creative development. I thrive in fast-paced environments, enjoy tackling problem-solving challenges, and love working collaboratively with diverse teams.
    <div></div>Lastly, a fun fact about me is that I love music/to dance in all styles! Hip-hop, jazz, and contemporary just to name a few.
